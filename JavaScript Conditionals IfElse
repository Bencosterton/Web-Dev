//Example of conditional statements in JS

var sale = true;
var sale = false;

if (sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!');

/* In the above, variable true on line 3 was changed to false on line 4, this code would render no answer. Deleting line 4 would render 
the answer "Time to buy!" */




// If Else statements

let sale = true;

sale = false;

if(sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!');
} else {
  console.log('Time to wait for a sale.');
